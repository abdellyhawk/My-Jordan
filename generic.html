				<h2 style="margin-left: 230px;">Petra</h2>
				<p style="margin-left: 230px;">
						Known as the "Rose-Red City," Petra is an ancient Nabatean city carved into rose-colored sandstone cliffs over 2,000 years ago. Once a thriving trading hub connecting the Silk Road, Arabia, and the Mediterranean, Petra is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Visitors enter through the Siq, a narrow, winding gorge, which opens up dramatically to reveal the iconic Treasury (Al-Khazneh). Beyond the Treasury, Petra offers a sprawling archaeological site with tombs, temples, an ancient amphitheater, and the impressive Monastery (Ad-Deir), perched high on a mountain and accessible via a challenging but rewarding hike.
				</p>

				<h2 style="margin-left: 230px;">Wadi Rum</h2>
				<p style="margin-left: 230px;">
						Also called the "Valley of the Moon," Wadi Rum is a dramatic desert landscape known for its red sand dunes, towering sandstone cliffs, and surreal rock formations. It has served as the backdrop for numerous films, including <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> and <i>The Martian</i>. Visitors can explore its beauty on jeep safaris, camel treks, or even hot-air balloon rides. At night, Wadi Rum becomes a stargazing haven, with crystal-clear skies perfect for observing constellations. Bedouin camps offer an authentic experience, where travelers can enjoy traditional meals, music, and stories around the campfire.
				</p>

				<h2 style="margin-left: 230px;">Dead Sea</h2>
				<p style="margin-left: 230px;">
						The Dead Sea, the lowest point on Earth at over 430 meters (1,412 feet) below sea level, is a natural wonder. Its high salt concentration—ten times saltier than most seawater—allows visitors to float effortlessly on its surface. The waters are rich in minerals, making them famous for their therapeutic properties, while the black mud along its shores is used in skincare treatments. The surrounding area also offers luxurious resorts and spas, perfect for relaxation. Additionally, the Dead Sea’s unique environment is home to historical sites, including the ancient fortress of Masada and the biblical site of Lot’s Cave.
				</p>

				<h2 style="margin-left: 230px;">Aqaba</h2>
				<p style="margin-left: 230px;">
						Aqaba, Jordan’s only coastal city, is a vibrant gateway to the Red Sea. Known for its crystal-clear waters and colorful coral reefs, it is a paradise for snorkeling, scuba diving, and other water sports. The marine life is diverse, with opportunities to see clownfish, sea turtles, and even shipwrecks. Aqaba also offers pristine beaches, luxury resorts, and a lively market where visitors can experience Jordanian hospitality and shop for local crafts. The city’s historical landmarks, like the Aqaba Fort and the Ayla archaeological site, add a cultural dimension to its seaside charm.
				</p>

				<h2 style="margin-left: 230px;">Jerash</h2>
				<p style="margin-left: 230px;">
						Often referred to as the "Pompeii of the East," Jerash is one of the best-preserved Roman cities in the world. The ancient city, located just north of Amman, features stunning colonnaded streets, grand temples dedicated to Zeus and Artemis, two well-preserved theaters, and a massive oval forum surrounded by columns. Visitors can also explore the remains of ancient baths, fountains, and city gates. The annual Jerash Festival brings the city to life with traditional music, dance, and cultural performances, making it a dynamic blend of ancient and modern Jordanian culture.
				</p>

				<h2 style="margin-left: 230px;">Mount Nebo</h2>
				<p style="margin-left: 230px;">
						Mount Nebo is a sacred biblical site believed to be the location where Moses viewed the Promised Land before his death. Perched at 817 meters (2,680 feet) above sea level, it offers sweeping views of the Jordan Valley, the Dead Sea, and, on clear days, even Jerusalem. The site is home to the Memorial Church of Moses, which houses beautifully preserved Byzantine mosaics depicting scenes of nature, hunting, and agriculture. Pilgrims and tourists alike visit Mount Nebo for its spiritual significance and its tranquil atmosphere. Nearby, visitors can explore the ancient town of Madaba, famous for its intricate mosaics, including the Madaba Map, the oldest known map of the Holy Land.
